## Case description
The goal to create a program that finds the number using the minimum number of attempts.

## Competition conditions
- The computer guesses a number between 0 and 100 and we need to find it with the program we are going to create.
- The algorithm takes into account information if the random number is greater or less than what we need.

## Quality assessment
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts in 1000 repetitions.

## What are we going to improve?
We are trying to create nice Python code.
